HangmanRepo
===========
Html and js are located in hangman/assets/www

The app was successfully combined with phonegap however I used the apk provided with eclipse with this project and not adobe build.

The app is a simple Hangman game. I used arrays and string manipulation to display the words I used and to compare with the users guess.
